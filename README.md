## Introduction: 

The Matlab codes computes the ground state energy for hydrogen (H), helium (He), lithium (Li), beryllium (Be), boron (B) and carbon (C) atoms by solving the time-independent Kohn-Sham (KS) equation in the local-density-approximation (LDA) of the density-functional theory (dft) [1]. The exchange and correlation contribution (E_xc) is computed in the Vosko, Wilk, and
Nusair (VWN) approximation.

## Requirement: 
Any version of Matlab 

## Implementation details and running

You may download and run them.
